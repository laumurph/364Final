This application allows people to search up information about pokemon, the regions, and towns that exist in there. Information comes from the Poke API. You are also able to log in and create an account. By doing so, you can see your personal information such as your region. Additionaly, if you search for pokemon and are logged in, you have the option to add them to your pokemon team. Once you add pokemon to your team, their names will be displayed on your personal page.
